Imagine with me that a customer bought a product from another marketer who uses these features on his site, and the product arrived to the customer with problems and didn't work, and the marketer didn't refund the money or return the product. When he sees any store with these same distinctive marks, he will think it is the same person, so be careful when using these features. They may benefit you in the short term and increase sales, but in the long run, they will damage your reputation.",
